# DigAll Graphical Interface 🌐

`DigAll` gets a facelift! Dive into DNS information retrieval with an enhanced, user-friendly graphical interface. Not only can you query for DNS details but also save that data effortlessly to a text file.

Kudos to [FreedomBen](https://github.com/FreedomBen/digall) for crafting the initial `digall` bash script. This project aims to rejuvenate and extend that stellar work into a visually engaging experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- **Tkinter**: This is typically bundled with most standard Python installations.

  On Windows, Bindutils isn't bundled by default. Here's how to get it up and running:
  ```bash
  # If you're a Chocolatey user:
  choco install bind-toolsonly
