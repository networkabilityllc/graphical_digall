# DigAll Graphical Interface

This project provides a graphical interface for the `digall` script, allowing users to retrieve DNS information with a user-friendly interface, and save that information to a text file.

## Credit

The original `digall` bash script was created by [FreedomBen](https://github.com/FreedomBen/digall). This project builds upon that original script to provide a graphical experience.

## Usage

This application uses tkinter and bindutils. In windows, you will need to install bind utils. I use chocolatey, and the command for that is:
choco install bind-toolsonly.

To run the program, clone the repository.

Windows: start python .\graphical_digall.py
Linux: python .\graphical_digall.py &
